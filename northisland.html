    <h3 class="miniTitle" id="LEFT">The North Island of New Zealand</h3>
    <p class="miniText MT2" id="LEFT">Maui wanted to go fishing with his older brothers, but they would never let him come. So one time he decided to hide in the boat, with the fishing hook he had previously made. Once they were far away from shore, Maui came out of his hiding place and suprised his brothers. His brothers still wouldn't let him use any bate, so used his own blood from his nose. He caught a big fish, known as HƒÅhau-whenua. But before Maui had time to thank Tangaroa (the god of the sea) for the gift of this land, Maui's brothers started cutting up the fish. The fish wasn't very happy and writhed from agony, which broke up into many moutains and cliffs. If Maui's brothers had done what they were told, the north island would of been flat.</p>
